I am a research engineer in the Department of Radiation Physics at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

I received his Ph.D. in the Physics and Astronomy department at the University of Georgia. My Ph.D. research focused primarily on development of a pharmacokinetic modeling in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and the development of image-processing algorithms for tumor segmentation. My research as a postdoctoral follow in Bioinformatics & Computational Biology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center has focused primarily on image processing on brain tumor images with various statistical techniques and machine learning. During this postdoctoral training, my projects ranged from texture analysis for the parametric map of DSC-MRI to the analysis of tumor heterogeneity in multiparametric MRI data.

My current research is on decoding tumor phenotype with Radiomics approach such as the extraction and analysis of advanced quantitative imaging features obtained from CT, PET or MRI. I am currently funded by the Center for Radiation Oncology (CROR) to provide radiomics research support to researchers throughout the institution.

### How Machine Learning Works
23
Machine learning uses two types of techniques: supervised learning, which trains a model on known input and output data so that it can predict future outputs, and unsupervised learning, which finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data.

### <span style="color:orange"> Supervised Learning  </span>
30
Supervised machine learning builds a model that makes predictions based on evidence in the presence of uncertainty. A supervised learning algorithm takes a known set of input data and known responses to the data (output) and trains a model to generate reasonable predictions for the response to new data. Use supervised learning if you have known data for the output you are trying to predict.

32
Supervised learning uses classification and regression techniques to develop predictive models.

**Classification techniques** predict discrete responses—for example, whether an email is genuine or spam, or whether a tumor is cancerous or benign. Classification models classify input data into categories. Typical applications include medical imaging, speech recognition, and credit scoring.
